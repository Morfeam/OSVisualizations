/*
 before you begin splitting the text, I would start by knowing how your arrays would look beforehand by hard coding them
 into your code and traversing them via your animations


knowing that i was going to use a 2d array, made it easier for me to visualize how i needed to split my data

    procHandler = [ [1,0,24,3] , [2,0,3,2] , [3,0,3,1] ]


 the splitting will look different for everyone since some file formats don't have any newline characters in them, and some
 include different characters such as - and :


 if you need help with anything, again, you can let me know here or by any other means of communication I have given to the 
 group and I will get back to you ASAP. */
